# RobotSwarm
This project was the introduction to feedback control loops. The problem was to be able to control the speed of two 360 servos using feedback in-order to get positioning. Positioning was caluclated using angular velocity which is explained more into detail in the project documentation. In this project we used CMSIS to configure the Analog inputs / PWM outputs. Moreover, some remote control settings were added by connecting the Nucleo to an ESP32 and communciating through UART. The user can control the robots movement through the node-red dashboard (flow file).
